<div class="biography">

<p><img src="images/bob1-bw.jpg"  alt="Bob Biography" class="bobsolo">Over 20 years ago I decided to learn how to play the guitar, and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life. Sports was certainly never a skill of mine. Watching the game of baseball is one thing, playing it in high school and having a batting average of .053 is another. After my attempt at sports as a freshman I decided to invest a majority of my downtime being the best musician I can possibly be and never looked back.</p>

<p>I have owned many electric and acoustic guitars, along with various effects pedals, combo amplifiers and halfstacks. My current lineup of gear includes two Gibson Les Paul Studio electric guitars, a Fender electric acoustic guitar, and a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe combo amplifier. In years past I have owned Jackson, Ibanez, and ESP guitars and for over 12 years I owned a Mesa Boogie Single Rectifier halfstack. My guitar influences range from classic rock to metal: Tony Iommi, Kirk Hammett, Zakk Wylde, Dimebag Darrell, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen.  </p>

<p>I've played close to 200 shows throughout the northeast, which includes playing at some of the most well known clubs and venues such as The Middle East, The Paradise, Worcester Palladium, and the historic CBGB in New York City. I have also recorded and performed guitar on several full length CDs & EPs consisting of originals and covers.</p>

<p>Along with being a musician and a songwriter, I have also played the role of Band Manager in projects I have been involved in, which became one of the main reasons I grew an interest in learning about marketing and promotions at all levels. Many of my responsibilities have included creating press kits, promotional flyers and
album artwork. I have also helped create, develop and manage band websites along with manage social media accounts. Booking over 80% of the shows I have played and submitting music to radio stations (commercial and college) were two of my favorite yet most challenging tasks but were also very rewarding. </p>
